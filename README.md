## 🏆 What is Machine Unlearning?

Machine unlearning refers to techniques that enable a trained machine learning model to **forget** or **remove** the influence of specific data points, often for privacy, compliance, or fairness reasons.  
This workshop provides hands-on resources to learn, experiment, and innovate in this emerging field.
